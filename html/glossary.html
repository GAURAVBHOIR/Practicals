hole, or any massive object growing in size by attracting material.<P>

created or destroyed. If the orbit is elliptical the radius will vary. 
Since the mass is constant, the velocity changes. Thus planets in elliptical 
orbits travel faster at <A HREF = "#periastron" onMouseover="return periastron_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">periastron</A> and more slowly at <A HREF = "#apastron" onMouseover="return apastron_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">apastron</A>.

The temperature of an object if it is re-radiating all the thermal energy

planetary motion</A>.  Brahe lost his nose in a dual in 1566 with
Manderup Parsberg (a fellow student and nobleman) at Rostock over who

infamous meal).<p>

<B><A NAME="Cepheid">Cepheid Variable</A></B><BR>
A type of variable star which exhibits a regular pattern of changing
brightness as a function of time.  The period of the pulsation pattern is

Polish astronomer who advanced the theory that the Earth and other

<B><A NAME="fermi_acceleration">Fermi acceleration</A></B><BR>
In order to explain the origins of <A HREF = "#cosmic_rays" onMouseover="return cosmic_rays_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">cosmic rays</A>, Enrico Fermi (1949) 
introduced a mechanism of particle acceleration, whereby charged particles 
bounce off moving interstellar <A HREF = "#magnetic_field" onMouseover="return magnetic_field_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">magnetic fields</A> and either gain or lose energy, 
depending on whether the &quot;magnetic mirror&quot; is approaching or receding. 
In a typical environment, he argued, the probability of a head-on collision is 
greater than a head-tail collision, so particles would be accelerated on 
average.  This random process is now called 2nd order Fermi acceleration, 
because the mean energy gain per &quot;bounce&quot; is dependent on the 
&quot;mirror&quot; velocity squared.<BR>

   Bell (1978) and Blandford and Ostriker (1978) independently showed that 
Fermi acceleration by supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is particularly 
efficient, because the motions are not random. A charged particle
ahead of the shock front can pass through the shock and then
be scattered by magnetic inhomogeneities behind the shock. The particle 
gains energy from this &quot;bounce&quot; and flies back across the shock,
where it can be scattered by magnetic inhomogeneities ahead of the shock. 
This enables the particle to bounce back and forth again and
again, gaining energy each time. This process is now called 1st order Fermi
acceleration, because the mean energy gain is dependent on the
shock velocity only to the first power.<P>

The smallest (quantum) unit of light/electromagnetic energy. Photons are generally regarded as particles with zero mass and no electric charge.<P>

<B><A NAME="photoelectric_effect">photoelectric effect</A></B><BR>
An effect explained by A. Einstein which demonstrates that light seems to be 
made up of particles, or photons. Light can excite electrons (called 
photoelectrons in this context) to be ejected from a metal. Light with a 
<A HREF = "#frequency" onMouseover="return frequency_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">frequency</A> below a certain threshold, at any intensity, will not cause any 
photoelectrons to be emitted from the metal. Above that frequency,
photoelectrons are emitted in proportion to the intensity of incident
light.<BR>

   The reason is that a photon has energy in proportion to its
wavelength, and the constant of proportionality is the Planck
constant. Below a certain frequency -- and thus below a certain 
energy -- the incident photons do not have enough energy to knock the
photoelectrons out of the metal.  Above that threshold energy, called
the work function, photons will knock the photoelectrons out of the
metal, in proportion to the number of photons (the intensity of the
light). At higher frequencies and energies, the photoelectrons ejected
obtain a kinetic energy corresponding to the difference between the
photon's energy and the work function.<P>

<B><A NAME="wave_particle_duality">wave-particle duality</A></B><BR>
The principle of quantum mechanics which implies that light (and, indeed, all 
other subatomic particles) sometimes act like a wave, and sometimes act like a 
particle, depending on the experiment you are performing. For instance, low

A star that has exhausted most or all of its nuclear fuel and has collapsed to a
very small size. Typically, a white dwarf has a radius equal to about 0.01 times
that of the Sun, but it has a mass roughly equal to the Sun's.  This gives a

radiancy and the thermodynamic temperature is a constant. As a result, as 
the temperature rises, the maximum of the radiant energy shifts toward the 
shorter wavelength (higher <A HREF = "#frequency" onMouseover="return frequency_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">frequency</A> and energy) end of the <A HREF = "#spectrum" onMouseover="return spectrum_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">spectrum</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="Z">Z</A></B><BR>
The ratio of the observed change in wavelength of light emitted by a 
moving object to the rest wavelength of the emitted light. See <A
HREF="#Doppler_effect" onMouseover="return Doppler_effect_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">Doppler Effect</A>.  This ratio is related to
the velocity of the object.  In general, with v = velocity of the 
object, c is the speed of light, lambda is the rest wavelength, and
delta-lambda is the observed change in the wavelength, z is given by 
<UL>
z = (delta-lambda)/lamda = (sqrt(1+v/c) / sqrt(1-v/c)) - 1.
</UL>
If the velocity of the object is small compared to the speed of
light, then 
<UL>
z = (delta-lambda)/lamda = v/c
</UL>
Objects at the furthest reaches of the known universe have values
of z = 5 or slightly greater.<P>
