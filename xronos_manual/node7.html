6. Windows </A>
</H1>     
    There are 4 different types of windows that can be used by XRONOS tasks:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Time Windows  : consist of up to 1000 time intervals
</LI>
<LI>Phase Windows : consist of an Epoch, a Period and up to 10 phase intervals
</LI>
<LI>Intensity Windows : consist of up to 10 intensity in bin, newbin and interval
</LI>
<LI>Exposure Windows : consist of up to 1 exposure in bin, newbin and interval
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If  any  window  is  required  during  the  analysis,  a window file
    containing  the  relevant  windows  must   be   created   with   the
    <TT>xronwin</TT> task,  before  running  a  XRONOS task.  The file may then be
    given as the value for the <TT>window</TT> parameter.

<P>
Time and Phase windows are applied to Bins.  Only those bins whose
    center time is  within the  start  and  stop  of  a  time  window  or
    phase  window (for a specified epoch and period) are accepted.

<P>
Intensity and Exposure Windows can be specified independently for: (i)
    Bins , (ii) New Bins , (iii) Intervals (applied in the given order).
    When dealing with more than one  time  series, Intensity and Exposure
    Windows must be specified separately for each series.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00710000000000000000">
6.1 Time Windows</A>
</H1>

<P>
Time Windows consist of up to 1000 start/stop times. Only those bins whose
    center time is within the start and stop times of a time window are accepted.
    Time Windows must be chronologically ordered.

<P>
Time windows may be specified in several formats, all of which will be
    automatically recognized by the <TT>xronwin</TT> task:

<P>

<P></P>

<PRE>
     * d = days ........................... e.g. 123.524268391
     * d s = day and sec .................. e.g. 123 45296.789
     * d h m s ms = day hr min sec msec ... e.g. 123 12 34 56 789
</PRE>

<P>
Time windows covering a larger duration than the input series are reset
    to the start and stop of the input series. The first interval can be
    forced to start at the start time of the first time window by
    specifying the hidden parameter, <TT>forcestart=yes</TT>, when executing the
    primary XRONOS tasks: autocor, crosscor, efold, efsearch, lcstats,
    lcurve, powspec, and timeskew.

<P>
NOTE, WHEN TIME WINDOWS ARE SET IN THE WINDOW FILE: The time used
    within XRONOS tasks  is  Truncated  Julian Days (TJD=  JD-2440000.5)
    if either (1) the keyword MJDREF is present in the header or (2) if the
    TIMESYS  value  is  one  of the  following strings  MJD  or JD or TJD.
    If (2), the time values are expected to be stored as JD, MJD or TJD in
    the header keywords and in  the  TIME column  in  which case the MJDREF
    keyword is not used (it should not be present).  When Time windows are
    set using <TT>xronwin</TT>, they must  be compatible  with  the values in header
    of the timing keywords and/or the values in the TIME column.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00720000000000000000">
6.2 Phase Windows</A>
</H1>

<P>
Phase Windows consist of an Epoch, a Period, and up to 10 start and
    stop Phases. Only those bins whose center time is within the specified
    start and stop phases (for the specified epoch and period) are
    accepted. Phases range from 0 to 1. Phase Windows must be phase
    ordered (except for the case in which the last window straddles phase
    0).

<P>
The Epoch may be specified in several formats, all of which will be
    automatically recognized by the <TT>xronwin</TT> task:

<P>

<P></P>

<PRE>
     * d = day ............................ e.g. 123.524268391
     * d s = day and sec .................. e.g. 123 45296.789
     * d h m s ms = day hr min sec msec ... e.g. 123 12 34 56 789
</PRE>
    Two formats are available to specify the Period:

<P>

<P></P>

<PRE>
     * D = day ............................ e.g. 0.1234567
     * S = sec ............................ e.g. 10666.659
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00730000000000000000">
6.3 Intensity Windows</A>
</H1>

<P>
Intensity Windows consist of a set of up to 10 minimum and maximum
    intensity levels. Units are the same as in input files (counts/s
    usually). Intensity windows must be ordered with increasing intensity
    and can be specified independently for the intensity of (i) Bins, (ii)
    Newbins, (iii) Intervals, for each of the series which is being
    analysed. Note that the "intensity" of an interval is its average
    intensity. Only those Bins, Newbins, and Intervals whose intensity is
    within the corresponding specified minimum and maximum intensities will
    be accepted.

<P>
Intensity windows in newbins can be used in conjunction with "Special
    Newbin Windows".  Special Newbin Windows are used to exclude the parts
    of a light curve which  immediately  follow  or precede  a  burst  or a
    background event which has been rejected by intensity  windows  in
    newbins.  The  Special  Window  operates  on newbins  in  conjunction
    with intensity windows (in newbins) and are specified  by   changing
    to   positive   values   the   parameters <TT>spwinbefore</TT>  and
    <TT>spwindowafter</TT>.  Their use is the following: if <I>e.g.</I> <TT>spwinbefore=10</TT>,
    all  newbins,  whose  center  time  is within  10  second before  the
    center time of a newbin rejected by intensity windows, will also be
    rejected; if <I>e.g.</I>  <TT>spwindowafter=20</TT>,  all newbins, whose center time
    is within 20 second after the center time of a newbin  rejected  by
    intensity  windows,  will also be rejected.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00740000000000000000">
6.4 Exposure Windows</A>
</H1>

<P>
Exposure Windows consist of a minimum and a maximum exposure level.
    Units are such that 1 means 100% exposure. Exposure windows can be
    specified independently for the exposure of (i) Bins, (ii) Newbins,
    (iii) Intervals, for each of the series which is being analysed.

<P>
Note that the Bin Exposure used by XRONOS tasks, besides dead time
    includes also instrument-dependent constants (<I>i.e.</I> the  collimator
    efficiency for the ME and GS, the normalisation for the LE) such that,
    when dealing with photon counting experiments, the relevant Poisson
    statistics can be reconstructed. For example if a 5 s bin in an input
    file has been effectively "exposed" only for 2 s (<I>e.g.</I> as a consequence
    of dead time effects, collimator efficiencies, data dropouts etc.),
    then its exposure is 40%.

<P>
The Newbin Exposure is obtained by propagating the bin exposures to
    each newbin; for example, if in a 30 s newbin the total exposure (due
    to the sum of the individual exposure of the bins contributing to the
    given newbin) is 18 s then its exposure is 60%.

<P>
The Interval Exposure is the ratio of accepted to expected newbins: for
    example, if a 128 newbin long interval contains only 32 accepted
    newbins, then its exposure is 25%.

<P>
Note that exposures can be higher than 100% (<I>e.g.</I> if the newbin time is
    not a multiple of the bin time, then "beats" are generated which might
    bring the exposure of a newbin to values <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$&gt;$">100%; or if two or more input
    files for the same time series overlap in part, some of the newbins
    will be more than 100% exposed).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00750000000000000000">
6.5 Default Windows</A>
</H1>

<P>
Default exposure windows are used in many XRONOS tasks, primarily
    to avoid analysing data sets which are too inhomogeneous with
    respect to their statistical properties. The default exposure windows are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Minimum Exposure in Bins     =0.25 (<I>i.e.</I> 25 % exposure)
</LI>
<LI>Minimum Exposure in Newbins  =0.01 (<I>i.e.</I>  1 % exposure)
</LI>
<LI>Minimum Exposure in Intervals=0.50 (<I>i.e.</I> 50 % exposure)
</LI>
<LI>Maximum Exposure =50.0 in Bins , Newbins and Interval
       (<I>i.e.</I> 5000 % exposure, meaning that virtually everything which is more than
       100 % exposed will be accepted).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
NOTE: The minimum default Exposure windows in an Interval is ignored in
    lcurve, efold, and efsearch.

<P>
Default exposure windows are used mainly for protection purposes, to
    maintain the statistical quality of the results from different
    intervals as homogeneous as possible. For example suppose that you have
    a 136 newbin series of which you want to calculate the average power
    spectrum in intervals of 64 newbins each.  Three intervals will be
    accumulated, two with 64 newbins each and one with 8 newbins. If there
    were no exposure windows in intervals, the power spectrum the third
    interval (containing only 8 newbins, <I>i.e.</I> 12.5 % exposed) would be
    averaged with the power spectra of the first two intervals (both
    containing 64 newbins, <I>i.e.</I> 100 % exposed).

<P>
The side-effects of default exposure windows can be annoying sometimes.
    For example, when intensity windows in bins or newbins have been
    specified, and it is difficult to evaluate a priori which fraction of
    bins and newbins will be accepted, one might end up with many newbins
    and/or intervals rejected by default exposure windows. Also when
    specifying time or phase windows, the default windows might need to be
    reset depending on what fraction of bins and newbins will actually be
    accepted.

<P>
If you do not want any exposure windows you can create (with
    <TT>xronwin</TT>) and use a window file containing no exposure windows.
