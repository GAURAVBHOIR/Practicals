    The input file format is FITS using the BINTABLE extension in either
    binned data format or event list format.  To specify multiple files
    a Filelist is recommended.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">
4.1 File format</A>
</H1>

<P>
The FITS input file format that XRONOS read is described in the "The
    proposed Timing FITS file format for High Energy Astrophysics data",
    1993, by Angelini, L. , W. Pence and A.F. Tennant (OGIP memo
    OGIP/93-003 <A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/timing3.html">http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/timing3.html</A> ).    The FITS input file are BINTABLE extension with two possible layouts
    one for binned data and another for event list. For both formats a
    column TIME is required in addition to timing header keywords. The TIME
    column is not required if data are equispaced and the gap marked.  The
    require timing header keywords are the following:

<P>

<P></P>

<PRE>
    MJDREF  =                        / MJD for reference time
    TSTART  =                        / start time
    TSTOP   =                        / stop stop
    TIMEZERO=                        / zero time used to calculate the
                                       n-time event or the n-time
    TIMESYS =                        / the system use to the define time
    TIMEUNIT=                        / Unit for TSTART, TSTOP, TIMEZERO
                                       valid also for the two keywords
                                       rapresentation
    TIMEDEL =                        / Integration time
</PRE>

<P>
TIMESYS records the time frame system used in the file. The IAU FITS
    Working Group in 1997 adopted this keyowrd as part of the FITS date
    definition encopassing the millenium reccomended a number of values
    (see <A HREF="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/standards/year2000.txt">http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/standards/year2000.txt</A> ) not    included in the Angelini <I>et al.</I> (1994).  Prior that decision the
    following values for TIMESYS were used :

<P>

<P></P>

<PRE>
     1- an arbitrary UT time, given as decimal years or as 'YYYY MM DD hh:mm:ss'
        (e.g. TIMESYS = '1980.0'  or TIMESYS = '1980 1 1 00:00:00';
     2- MDJ, JD, or TJD which define the various Julian day representations,
        mainly to accomodate older mission;
     3- 'scc' (for spacecraft clock used in the ROSAT data).
        Note TIMESYS is not a required keyword.
</PRE>

<P>
MJDREF is the reference time given as a MJD, using the following
    convention MJD=JD-2400000.5.  Time written in the TIME column and in
    the timing header keywords are offset from this value.  MJDREF is not
    required and if missing the values in the TIME column are treated as
    absolute.  This quantity can be specified in two keywords, MJDREFI and
    MJDREFF for integer and fraction, when necessary to retain precision.

<P>
TSTART, and TSTOP give the start and the stop of the data included in
    file in units specified by the TIMEUNIT keyword. These quantities can
    be specified in two keywords, TSTARTI and TSTARTF (TSTOPI and TSTOPF)
    for integer and fraction, when necessary to retain precision. These
    keywords are required. If MJDREF is present they are offset from
    MDJREF, otherwsie should have values comparable (written in the same
    time system) to those in the TIME column. TSTART and TSTOP should
    include also any offset stored in the TIMEZERO keyword.

<P>
TIMEZERO is an offset used to calculate the time for each bin or event
    in the table when the TIME column is not present. This quantity can be
    specified in two keywords, TIMEZERI and TIMEZERF for integer and
    fraction, when necessary to retain precision. Note that if the TIME
    column is present and TIMEZERO is not zero this value is added to the
    values in the time colum and the result value should be always included
    in the interval defined by the TSTART and TSTOP.  The value of TIMEZERO
    should be written in the same time system of TSTART and TSTOP and with
    units defined in TIMEUNIT.

<P>
TIMEUNIT gives the time unit used for the TSTART, TSTOP, and TIMEZERO
    keywords. It is a required keyword. TIMEUNIT is used by the software to
    make the value of the keywords compatible with the units of the 'TIME'
    column. The recommended units code follows the IAU convention, <I>i.e.</I> 's'
    for second and 'd' for day, and is described in OGIP/93-001 document
    (George and Angelini 1993). If 's' is specified it is assumed that all
    the time header keywords are in units of seconds (TSTART, TSTOP and
    TIMEZERO).

<P>
TIMEDEL gives the integration time of the data. NOTE that TIMEDEL can
    be applied to binned data or to event data (for example CCD data). The
    units are defined in TIMEUNIT.

<P>
The TIME column contains either the tagged time for each event or the
    center of the bin.  The time can be expressed as residual time from
    TIMEZERO (that in turn is an offset from MJDREF if defined) or as full
    time since MJDREF or an user defined time system.  The TIME column
    values for binned data always refer to the center of the bin, unless
    the keyword TIMEPIXR specify otherwise. The units are stored in the
    TUNITn keyword with recommended unit abbreviations of 's' for seconds
    and 'd' for days.

<P>
TIMEPIXR gives the position of time stamp value within a bin. The
    tipical values are 0 for the beginning of the bin, 0.5 for the middle
    of the bin and 1 for the end of the bin. If TIMEPIXR is absent, the
    default value is 0.5 (This keyword was not present in the OGIP/93-003)

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00511000000000000000">
4.1.1 Event data</A>
</H2>

<P>
An Event file has only one required column, 'TIME', which gives the
    recorded time for each event.  Other column as PHA can be included when
    the instrument for example allows data to be resolved in energy. The
    important key is that each row (n) contains single-value parameters for
    the event n. The Event table must be accompany by a GTI extension to
    allow to determine the exposure in each bin. A tipical event table
    suitable as xronos input file can have the following header:

<P>

<P></P>

<PRE>
     MJDREF  = 49718                / MJD for reference file
     TIMESYS = '1995 1 1 00:00:00 ' / The time system is MJD
     TIMEUNIT= 'd       '           / unit for TSTARTI/F and TSTOPI/F
     TSTART  =  800                 / observation start time
     TSTOP   =  801                 / observationstop time
     TIMEZERO= 0.0                  / zerotime to calculate t(n) event or bin
     TTYPE1  = 'TIME    '           / time of measurement
     TFORM1  = '1D      '           / data format of the field: DOUBLE PRECISION
     TUNIT1  = 'd       '           / physical unit of field
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00512000000000000000">
4.1.2 Bin data</A>
</H2>

<P>
The binned data table requires the columns, RATE (ERROR), COUNTS which
    contain the intensity of the source detected in the integrated bin.
    Additional column can be present as TIME or FRACEXP. The FRACEXP
    contians the fraction exposure, compared with the integration time
    stored in the header keywords TIMEDEL, with value ranging from 0 to 1
    (full exposure).  The TIME column is data are not equispaced or gap are
    not marked.

<P>
To  input multiple files for each time series, a file containing the
    list of files is needed (Filelist). The Filelist  is  input  in  the
    program  as  <TT>@Filelist</TT>.  The format of this file list is ascii and
    contains one filename+options per line. Files from  different  times
    series  are  separated  by  '///'  mark.  Below is an example of the
    Filelist containing 2 files for 3 different times series.

4.3 Input File Options</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Input File Options (up to 10) can be specified for each file  in
    the  same  input string.  They consist of 2 characters followed by a
    numerical constant (up to 8 character long).  There are  two  groups
    of   options.   The  first  allows  data  selection  within  a  FITS
    extension. The available options within this group are :

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>frN</TT>= start reading input file from row number N (First Row)
</LI>
<LI><TT>lrN</TT>= stop  reading input file at   row number N (Last  Row)
</LI>
<LI><TT>vxN</TT>= use column number N as x-axis (<I>i.e.</I> time axis, default: TIME)
</LI>
<LI><TT>vyN</TT>= use column number N as y-axis (default: COUNT or RATE)
</LI>
<LI><TT>vsN</TT>= use column number N as error for y-axis (default: ERROR)
</LI>
<LI><TT>veN</TT>= use column number N as exposure (default: FRACEXP)
              If the input file is an event list, exposure is by default
              calculated using the GTI extension. In this case, N=0
              turns off the usage of the GTI extension for the exposure
              calculation.
</LI>
<LI><TT>feN</TT>= select data (either binned or events) from channel number N
              (First Energy).  For event list the default column channel
              name searched is PHA.  The option <TT>vcN</TT> allows the choice
              of a channel column name different from PHA (es. PI).
</LI>
<LI><TT>leN</TT>= select data (either binned or events) to channel number N
              (Last Energy).  Event list channel selection is identical
              to <TT>feN</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>vcN</TT>= use column number N for channel selection (valid only for event lists)
</LI>
<LI><TT>rtN</TT>= use extension N of the FITS file to read the data. The first
              extension is N=1 (the primary array is irrelevant). To specify
              the extension the following also can be used: <TT>filename[N]</TT> or
              <TT>filename+N</TT>.
</LI>
<LI><TT>of</TT> = The MJDREF keyword is not used. The time is calculated using
              the TIME column and the TIMEZERO keyword.

</UL>

<P>
The  second  group  of  options  performs  algebraic  operations  on
    individual  input  files.   They  are  applied  in the same order in
    which are specified. For event files  they  are  applied  after  the
    data are binned. The available options within this group are:

</LI>
<LI><TT>qaX</TT>= add to data the square of data multiplied by X and add to errors the
              product of data and error multiplied by X. (This is used to multiply
              data (Y) and errors (SY) by a linear interpolation constant:
